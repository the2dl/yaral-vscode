# Yara-L For VSCode

Syntax highlighting for the Chronicle Yara-L Language.

## Installation

- Install node first
- npm install -g @vscode/vsce
- vsce package

From here a vsix file will be dropped which you can manually import into VSCode.

## Features

This extension in its current state is meant to match syntax highlighting as close as possible to the built-in IDE within Chronicle to utilize while working with Detection-As-Code.

## Pull Requests

Submit them, I'll merge them. Would love to see more than just Syntax Highlighting, but this was just a start.

## Colors

Make sure to load up the contents of settings.json in the .vscode directory to match as closely as possible to Chronicle's IDE. 

## Issues

Open issues and if I get time I'll try to fix them. I'm sure there are other regex conditons I didn't think of while building this out.
